\section{Understanding Real Outcomes Through Data }

I am a senior double majoring in Economics and Information Science and Technology, 
and most of my interests sit at the intersection of data, technology, and real-world 
problems. I am especially interested in healthcare and development, mainly because 
I have seen how limited resources, weak systems, and poor information flows can shape 
people’s outcomes long before individual choices even come into play. What draws me 
to economics is its ability to take these lived realities and turn them into 
questions that we can study, test, and hopefully improve.

I decided to take this class because I want to be more intentional about how I work 
with data from start to finish. Although I have used data tools in other courses, I 
wanted a stronger foundation in reproducible workflows, version control, and clear 
documentation. Learning tools like Git, GitHub and \LaTeX{} feels important not just 
for this class, but for the kind of collaborative and transparent work I hope to do 
in the future.

For my course project, I am interested in exploring how digital capacity and health 
infrastructure work together to influence health outcomes, particularly in Southern 
African countries. I am curious whether technology strengthens existing health 
systems or whether its impact depends on having certain foundations already in place. 
I would like to use panel data to study these relationships over time and across 
countries, with the goal of asking questions that are empirically grounded and 
relevant for policy.

After graduation, I plan to work full-time to gain hands-on experience applying 
economic and data analysis in real-world settings. After a couple of years, I intend 
to pursue graduate studies in Health Economics to deepen my training and sharpen my 
research focus. In the long run, I hope to work in research or policy-oriented roles 
where I can use data and economic analysis to improve health outcomes, especially in 
resource-constrained settings.
